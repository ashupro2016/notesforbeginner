The Java platform differs from most other platforms in
 that it's a software-only platform
 that runs on top of other hardware-based platforms.
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Java platform has two components:

-The Java Virtual Machine
-The Java Application Programming Interface (API)
You've already been introduced to the Java Virtual Machine; it's the base for the Java platform and is ported onto various hardware-based platforms.

The API is a large collection of ready-made software components that 
provide many useful capabilities. It is grouped into libraries of related classes and interfaces; 
these libraries are known as packages.

As a platform-independent environment, the Java platform can be a bit slower than native code.
 However, advances in compiler and virtual machine technologies are bringing performance close to that of native code without threatening portability.

The terms"Java Virtual Machine" and "JVM" mean a Virtual Machine for the Java platform.
