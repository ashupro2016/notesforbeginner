->SELECT TOP 2 * FROM Customers;
->SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM Customers;
-----------------------------------------------------
SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.

What is SQL?
SQL stands for Structured Query Language
SQL lets you access and manipulate databases
SQL is an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Using SQL in Your Web Site
To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:

An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)
To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP
To use SQL to get the data you want
To use HTML / CSS
--------------------------------------------------
RDBMS
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.

RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.

The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables.

A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
->SELECT * FROM Customers;
->SELECT CustomerName,City FROM Customers;
-------------------------------------------------------
The SQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement
In a table, a column may contain many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.

The DISTINCT keyword can be used to return only distinct (different) values.
->SELECT DISTINCT column_name,column_name
FROM table_name;
->SELECT DISTINCT City FROM Customers;
--------------------------------------------------------
The SQL WHERE Clause 
The WHERE clause is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified criterion.
->SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Mexico';
->SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID=1;
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The SQL AND & OR Operators
The AND operator displays a record if both the first condition AND the second condition are true.

The OR operator displays a record if either the first condition OR the second condition is true.
->SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
AND City='Berlin';
->SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City='Berlin'
OR City='München';
->SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
AND (City='Berlin' OR City='München');
--------------------------------------------------------------
The SQL ORDER BY Keyword
The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set by one or more columns.

The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in a descending order, you can use the DESC keyword.
->SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country;
->SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country DESC;
->SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country, CustomerName;
->SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;
-----------------------------------------------------------
The SQL INSERT INTO Statement
The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table.
->INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
VALUES ('Cardinal','Tom B. Erichsen','Skagen 21','Stavanger','4006','Norway');
->INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)
VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Stavanger', 'Norway');
---------------------------------------------------------------
->UPDATE Customers
SET City='Hamburg'
WHERE CustomerID=1;

UPDATE Multiple Columns
To update more than one column, use a comma as seperator.

Assume we wish to update the customer "Alfreds Futterkiste" with a new contact person and city.

->UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName='Alfred Schmidt', City='Frankfurt'
WHERE CustomerID=1;

->UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName='Juan'
WHERE Country='Mexico';

NOTE:-Be careful when updating records. If we omit the WHERE clause, ALL records will be updated:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The DELETE statement is used to delete records in a table.
->DELETE FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste' AND ContactName='Maria Anders';

Delete All Data
=It is possible to delete all rows in a table without deleting the table. This means that the table structure, attributes, and indexes will be intact:
->DELETE FROM table_name;

or

->DELETE * FROM table_name;
--------------------------------------------------------------
SQL Injection
SQL injection is a technique where malicious users can inject SQL commands into an SQL statement, via web page input.

Injected SQL commands can alter SQL statement and compromise the security of a web application.


-SQL Injection Based on 1=1 is Always True
Look at the example above, one more time.

Let's say that the original purpose of the code was to create an SQL statement to select a user with a given user id.

If there is nothing to prevent a user from entering "wrong" input, the user can enter some "smart" input like this:

->SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105 or 1=1;
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The SQL SELECT TOP Clause
The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return.

The SELECT TOP clause can be very useful on large tables with thousands of records. Returning a large number of records can impact on performance.
->SELECT TOP 2 * FROM Customers;
->SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM Customers;
---------------------------------------------------------------

SQL LIKE Operator

=The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with the letter "s":
->SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE 's%';

Tip: The "%" sign is used to define wildcards (missing letters) both before and after the pattern. You will learn more about wildcards in the next chapter.

The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City ending with the letter "s":
->SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '%s';

The following SQL statement selects all customers with a Country containing the pattern "land":
->SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country LIKE '%land%';

Using the NOT keyword allows you to select records that do NOT match the pattern.

The following SQL statement selects all customers with Country NOT containing the pattern "land":
->SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country NOT LIKE '%land%';
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SQL Wildcards:
A wildcard character can be used to substitute for any other character(s) in a string.

The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "ber":
->SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE 'ber%';

the following SQL statement selects all customers with a City containing the pattern "es": 
->SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '%es%';

The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with any character, followed by "erlin":
->SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '_erlin';


The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "L", followed by any character, followed by "n", followed by any character, 
followed by "on":
->SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE 'L_n_on';


The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "b", "s", or "p":
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '[bsp]%';

The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "a", "b", or "c":
->SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '[a-c]%';

The two following SQL statements selects all customers with a City NOT starting with "b", "s", or "p":
->SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '[!bsp]%';

or

->SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City NOT LIKE '[bsp]%';
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The IN Operator
The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.

The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City of "Paris" or "London":
->SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City IN ('Paris','London');

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The BETWEEN operator is used to select values within a range.

The SQL BETWEEN Operator
The BETWEEN operator selects values within a range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates.
->SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;

To display the products outside the range of the previous example, use NOT BETWEEN:
->SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 20;


The following SQL statement selects all products with a price BETWEEN 10 and 20, but products with a CategoryID of 1,2, or 3 should not be displayed:
->SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE (Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20)
AND NOT CategoryID IN (1,2,3);

The following SQL statement selects all products with a ProductName beginning with any of the letter BETWEEN 'C' and 'M':
->SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE ProductName BETWEEN 'C' AND 'M';

The following SQL statement selects all products with a ProductName beginning with any of the letter NOT BETWEEN 'C' and 'M':
->SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE ProductName NOT BETWEEN 'C' AND 'M';

The following SQL statement selects all orders with an OrderDate BETWEEN '04-July-1996' and '09-July-1996':
->SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN #07/04/1996# AND #07/09/1996#;


Notice that the BETWEEN operator can produce different result in different databases!
In some databases, BETWEEN selects fields that are between and excluding the test values.
In other databases, BETWEEN selects fields that are between and including the test values.
And in other databases, BETWEEN selects fields between the test values, including the first test value and excluding the last test value.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SQL aliases are used to temporarily rename a table or a column heading.


SQL Aliases
SQL aliases are used to give a database table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.

Basically aliases are created to make column names more readable.


Alias Example for Table Columns
The following SQL statement specifies two aliases, one for the CustomerName column and one for the ContactName column. 
Tip: It requires double quotation marks or square brackets if the column name contains spaces:
->SELECT CustomerName AS Customer, ContactName AS [Contact Person]
FROM Customers;

In the following SQL statement we combine four columns (Address, City, PostalCode, and Country) and create an alias named "Address":
->SELECT CustomerName, Address+', '+City+', '+PostalCode+', '+Country AS Address
FROM Customers;

To get the SQL statement above to work in MySQL use the following:
->SELECT CustomerName, CONCAT(Address,', ',City,', ',PostalCode,', ',Country) AS Address
FROM Customers;


Alias Example for Tables
The following SQL statement selects all the orders from the customer with CustomerID=4 (Around the Horn). We use the "Customers" and
 "Orders" tables, and give them the table aliases of "c" and "o" respectively (Here we have used aliases to make the SQL shorter):

->SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, c.CustomerName
FROM Customers AS c, Orders AS o
WHERE c.CustomerName="Around the Horn" AND c.CustomerID=o.CustomerID;


The same SQL statement without aliases:
->SELECT Orders.OrderID, Orders.OrderDate, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Customers, Orders
WHERE Customers.CustomerName="Around the Horn" AND Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID;


Aliases can be useful when:

There are more than one table involved in a query
Functions are used in the query
Column names are big or not very readable
Two or more columns are combined together
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SQL joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables.


SQL JOIN
An SQL JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a common field between them.
The most common type of join is: SQL INNER JOIN (simple join). An SQL INNER JOIN returns all rows from multiple tables where the join condition is met.

Notice that the "CustomerID" column in the "Orders" table refers to the "CustomerID" in the "Customers" table. The relationship between the two 
tables above is the "CustomerID" column.

Then, if we run the following SQL statement (that contains an INNER JOIN):

->SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers
ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;


Different SQL JOINs
Before we continue with examples, we will list the types of the different SQL JOINs you can use:

INNER JOIN: Returns all rows when there is at least one match in BOTH tables
LEFT JOIN: Return all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table
RIGHT JOIN: Return all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table
FULL JOIN: Return all rows when there is a match in ONE of the tables
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SQL INNER JOIN Keyword
The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns in both tables.

->SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;

Note: The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns. 
If there are rows in the "Customers" table that do not have matches in "Orders", these customers will NOT be listed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SQL LEFT JOIN Keyword
The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all rows from the left table (table1), with the matching rows in the right table (table2).
 The result is NULL in the right side when there is no match.

SQL LEFT JOIN Syntax
->SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name=table2.column_name;

     
     OR
->SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name=table2.column_name;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SQL LEFT JOIN Example
The following SQL statement will return all customers, and any orders they might have:

->SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;

Note: The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all the rows from the left table (Customers), even if there are no matches in the right table (Orders).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SQL RIGHT JOIN Keyword
The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all rows from the right table (table2), with the matching rows in the left table (table1). 
The result is NULL in the left side when there is no match.

SQL RIGHT JOIN Syntax

->SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name=table2.column_name;

       OR
->SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name=table2.column_name;




The following SQL statement will return all employees, and any orders they have placed:

->SELECT Orders.OrderID, Employees.FirstName
FROM Orders
RIGHT JOIN Employees
ON Orders.EmployeeID=Employees.EmployeeID
ORDER BY Orders.OrderID;

Note: The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all the rows from the right table (Employees), even if there are no matches in the left table (Orders).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SQL FULL OUTER JOIN Keyword
The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all rows from the left table (table1) and from the right table (table2).

The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword combines the result of both LEFT and RIGHT joins.

SQL FULL OUTER JOIN Syntax:
->SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name=table2.column_name;



The following SQL statement selects all customers, and all orders:
->SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;

Note: The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all the rows from the left table (Customers), and all the rows from 
the right table (Orders). If there are rows in "Customers"
 that do not have matches in "Orders", or if there are rows in "Orders" that do not have matches in "Customers", those rows will be listed as well.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The SQL UNION Operator
The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.
Notice that each SELECT statement within the UNION must have the same number of columns. 
The columns must also have similar data types. Also, the columns in each SELECT statement must be in the same order.

SQL UNION Syntax:-
->SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
 UNION 
 SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;


Note: The UNION operator selects only distinct values by default. To allow duplicate values, use the ALL keyword with UNION.
->SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 
 UNION ALL
 SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;


PS: The column names in the result-set of a UNION are usually equal to the column names in the first SELECT statement in the UNION.

SQL UNION Example:-
The following SQL statement selects all the different cities (only distinct values) from the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" tables:
->SELECT City FROM Customers
  UNION
  SELECT City FROM Suppliers
  ORDER BY City;



The following SQL statement uses UNION ALL to select all (duplicate values also) cities from the "Customers" and "Suppliers" tables:
->SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION ALL
SELECT City FROM Suppliers
ORDER BY City;




SQL UNION ALL With WHERE:-
The following SQL statement uses UNION ALL to select all (duplicate values also) German cities from the "Customers" and "Suppliers" tables:
	
->SELECT City, Country FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
UNION ALL
SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country='Germany'
ORDER BY City;// note:'germany' and 'Germany' different string,case sensitive

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The SQL SELECT INTO Statement
The SELECT INTO statement selects data from one table and inserts 
it into a new table.

SQL SELECT INTO Syntax
We can copy all columns into the new table:

->SELECT *
  INTO newtable [IN externaldb]
  FROM table1;

Or we can copy only the columns we want into the new table:

->SELECT column_name(s)
  INTO newtable [IN externaldb]
  FROM table1;


NOTE:The new table will be created with the column-names and types
 as defined in the SELECT statement. You can apply new names using
 the AS clause.

SQL SELECT INTO Examples:-

Create a backup copy of Customers:
->SELECT *
  INTO CustomersBackup2013
  FROM Customers;

Use the IN clause to copy the table into another database:
->SELECT *
  INTO CustomersBackup2013 IN 'Backup.mdb'
  FROM Customers;

Copy only a few columns into the new table:

->SELECT CustomerName, ContactName
  INTO CustomersBackup2013
  FROM Customers;

Copy only the German customers into the new table:
->SELECT *
  INTO CustomersBackup2013
  FROM Customers
  WHERE Country='Germany';

Copy data from more than one table into the new table:

->SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
  INTO CustomersOrderBackup2013
  FROM Customers
  LEFT JOIN Orders
  ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID;

Tip: The SELECT INTO statement can also be used to create a new, 
empty table using the schema of another. Just add a WHERE clause 
that causes the query to return no data:

->SELECT *
  INTO newtable
  FROM table1
  WHERE 1=0;
------------------------------------------------------

The SQL INSERT INTO SELECT Statement

The INSERT INTO SELECT statement selects data from one table
 and inserts it into an existing table. Any existing rows in
 the target table are unaffected.

SQL INSERT INTO SELECT Syntax
We can copy all columns from one table to another, existing table:

->INSERT INTO table2
  SELECT * FROM table1;

Or we can copy only the columns we want to into another, existing table:

->INSERT INTO table2
  (column_name(s))
  SELECT column_name(s)
  FROM table1;

SQL INSERT INTO SELECT Examples

Copy only a few columns from "Suppliers" into "Customers":

->INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, Country)
  SELECT SupplierName, Country FROM Suppliers;

Copy only the German suppliers into "Customers":
-> INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, Country)
   SELECT SupplierName, Country FROM Suppliers
   WHERE Country='Germany';
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The SQL CREATE DATABASE Statement
The CREATE DATABASE statement is used to create a database.

SQL CREATE DATABASE Syntax

->CREATE DATABASE dbname;

SQL CREATE DATABASE Example
The following SQL statement creates a database called "my_db":
->CREATE DATABASE my_db;

Database tables can be added with the CREATE TABLE statement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The SQL CREATE TABLE Statement
The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a table in a database.

Tables are organized into rows and columns; and each table must
 have a name.

SQL CREATE TABLE Syntax:

->CREATE TABLE table_name
  (
  column_name1 data_type(size),
  column_name2 data_type(size),
  column_name3 data_type(size),
  ....
  );
The column_name parameters specify the names of the columns of 
the table.

The data_type parameter specifies what type of data the column 
can hold (e.g. varchar, integer, decimal, date, etc.).

The size parameter specifies the maximum length of the column of 
the table.


SQL CREATE TABLE Example
Now we want to create a table called "Persons" that contains five
 columns: PersonID, LastName, FirstName, Address, and City.

We use the following CREATE TABLE statement:

Example:

->CREATE TABLE Persons
  (
  PersonID int,
  LastName varchar(255),
  FirstName varchar(255),
  Address varchar(255),
  City varchar(255)
  );

The PersonID column is of type int and will hold an integer.

The LastName, FirstName, Address, and City columns are of 
type varchar and will hold characters, and the maximum length
 for these fields is 255 characters.

The empty "Persons" table will now look like this:

Tip: The empty table can be filled with data with the INSERT INTO
 statement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

SQL Constraints

SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table.

 If there is any violation between the constraint and the data
 action, the action is aborted by the constraint.

Constraints can be specified when the table is created (inside the
 CREATE TABLE statement) or after the table is created (inside the 
ALTER TABLE statement).

SQL CREATE TABLE + CONSTRAINT Syntax

CREATE TABLE table_name
(
column_name1 data_type(size) constraint_name,
column_name2 data_type(size) constraint_name,
column_name3 data_type(size) constraint_name,
....
);

In SQL, we have the following constraints:

NOT NULL - Indicates that a column cannot store NULL value
UNIQUE - Ensures that each row for a column must have a unique value
PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Ensures that a column (or combination of two or more columns) have a unique identity which helps to find a particular record in a table more easily and quickly
FOREIGN KEY - Ensure the referential integrity of the data in one table to match values in another table
CHECK - Ensures that the value in a column meets a specific condition
DEFAULT - Specifies a default value for a column

--------------------------------------------------------------------

SQL NOT NULL Constraint:

By default, a table column can hold NULL values.

The NOT NULL constraint enforces a column to NOT accept NULL values.

The NOT NULL constraint enforces a field to always contain a value.
 This means that you cannot insert a new record, or update a record
 without adding a value to this field.

The following SQL enforces the "P_Id" column and the "LastName" 
column to not accept NULL values:

EXAMPLE:

->CREATE TABLE PersonsNotNull
  (
  P_Id int NOT NULL,
  LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  FirstName varchar(255),
  Address varchar(255),
  City varchar(255)
)


-----------------------------------------------------------------
SQL UNIQUE Constraint
The UNIQUE constraint uniquely identifies each record in a 
database table.

The UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints both provide a guarantee 
for uniqueness for a column or set of columns.

A PRIMARY KEY constraint automatically has a UNIQUE constraint 
defined on it.

Note that you can have many UNIQUE constraints per table, but only
 one PRIMARY KEY constraint per table.

SQL UNIQUE Constraint on CREATE TABLE

The following SQL creates a UNIQUE constraint on the "P_Id" column
 when the "Persons" table is created:

SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

->CREATE TABLE Persons
  (
  P_Id int NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  FirstName varchar(255),
  Address varchar(255),
  City varchar(255)
 )
MySQL:

CREATE TABLE Persons
(
P_Id int NOT NULL,
LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
FirstName varchar(255),
Address varchar(255),
City varchar(255),
UNIQUE (P_Id)
)

To allow naming of a UNIQUE constraint, and for defining a UNIQUE
 constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:

MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

->CREATE TABLE Persons
  (
  P_Id int NOT NULL,
  LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  FirstName varchar(255),
  Address varchar(255),
  City varchar(255),
  CONSTRAINT uc_PersonID UNIQUE (P_Id,LastName)
  )


SQL UNIQUE Constraint on ALTER TABLE
To create a UNIQUE constraint on the "P_Id" column when the table
 is already created, use the following SQL:

MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

->ALTER TABLE Persons
  ADD UNIQUE (P_Id)

To allow naming of a UNIQUE constraint, and for defining a UNIQUE
 constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:

MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

->ALTER TABLE Persons
  ADD CONSTRAINT uc_PersonID UNIQUE (P_Id,LastName)



To DROP a UNIQUE Constraint
To drop a UNIQUE constraint, use the following SQL:

MySQL:
->ALTER TABLE Persons
  DROP INDEX uc_PersonID

SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:
->ALTER TABLE Persons
  DROP CONSTRAINT uc_PersonID

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
SQL PRIMARY KEY Constraint
The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a 
database table.

Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values.

A primary key column cannot contain NULL values.

Most tables should have a primary key, and each table can have 
only ONE primary key.


SQL PRIMARY KEY Constraint on CREATE TABLE
The following SQL creates a PRIMARY KEY on the "P_Id" column when
 the "Persons" table is created:
MYSQL:

->CREATE TABLE Persons
 (
 P_Id int NOT NULL,
 LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
 FirstName varchar(255),
 Address varchar(255),
 City varchar(255),
 PRIMARY KEY (P_Id)
)

SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

->CREATE TABLE Persons
 (
 P_Id int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
 LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
 FirstName varchar(255),
 Address varchar(255),
 City varchar(255)
 )


To allow naming of a PRIMARY KEY constraint, and for defining a
 PRIMARY KEY constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL
 syntax:

MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

->CREATE TABLE Persons
 (
 P_Id int NOT NULL,
 LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
 FirstName varchar(255),
 Address varchar(255),
 City varchar(255),
 CONSTRAINT pk_PersonID PRIMARY KEY (P_Id,LastName)
 )

Note: In the example above there is only ONE PRIMARY KEY 
(pk_PersonID). However, the VALUE of the primary key is made
 up of TWO COLUMNS (P_Id + LastName).


SQL PRIMARY KEY Constraint on ALTER TABLE
To create a PRIMARY KEY constraint on the "P_Id" column when the
 table is already created, use the following SQL:


MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

->ALTER TABLE Persons
 ADD PRIMARY KEY (P_Id)


To allow naming of a PRIMARY KEY constraint, and for 
defining a PRIMARY KEY constraint on multiple columns,
 use the following SQL syntax:

MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

->ALTER TABLE Persons
 ADD CONSTRAINT pk_PersonID PRIMARY KEY (P_Id,LastName)

Note: If you use the ALTER TABLE statement to add a primary key,
 the primary key column(s) must already have been declared to not
 contain NULL values (when the table was first created).



To DROP a PRIMARY KEY Constraint

To drop a PRIMARY KEY constraint, use the following SQL:

MySQL:
->ALTER TABLE Persons
  DROP PRIMARY KEY

SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

->ALTER TABLE Persons
  DROP CONSTRAINT pk_PersonID
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SQL FOREIGN KEY Constraint
A FOREIGN KEY in one table points to a PRIMARY KEY in another table.

SQL FOREIGN KEY Constraint on CREATE TABLE
The following SQL creates a FOREIGN KEY on the "P_Id" column when
 the "Orders" table is created:

MySQL:

->CREATE TABLE Orders
(
O_Id int NOT NULL,
OrderNo int NOT NULL,
P_Id int,
PRIMARY KEY (O_Id),
FOREIGN KEY (P_Id) REFERENCES Persons(P_Id)
)


SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

->CREATE TABLE Orders
(
O_Id int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
OrderNo int NOT NULL,
P_Id int FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Persons(P_Id)
)

To allow naming of a FOREIGN KEY constraint, and for defining a 
FOREIGN KEY constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL
 syntax:

MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

->CREATE TABLE Orders
(
O_Id int NOT NULL,
OrderNo int NOT NULL,
P_Id int,
PRIMARY KEY (O_Id),
CONSTRAINT fk_PerOrders FOREIGN KEY (P_Id)
REFERENCES Persons(P_Id)
)

----------------------------------------
SQL FOREIGN KEY Constraint on ALTER TABLE
To create a FOREIGN KEY constraint on the "P_Id" column 
when the "Orders" table is already created, use the 
following SQL:

MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

->ALTER TABLE Orders
ADD FOREIGN KEY (P_Id)
REFERENCES Persons(P_Id)

To allow naming of a FOREIGN KEY constraint, and for defining 
a FOREIGN KEY constraint on multiple columns, use the following
 SQL syntax:
MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

->ALTER TABLE Orders
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_PerOrders
FOREIGN KEY (P_Id)
REFERENCES Persons(P_Id)

------------------------------------------------
To DROP a FOREIGN KEY Constraint
To drop a FOREIGN KEY constraint, use the following SQL:

MySQL:
->ALTER TABLE Orders
DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_PerOrders

SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:
->ALTER TABLE Orders
DROP CONSTRAINT fk_PerOrders
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SQL CHECK Constraint
The CHECK constraint is used to limit the value range that can 
be placed in a column.

If you define a CHECK constraint on a single column it allows only
 certain values for this column.

If you define a CHECK constraint on a table it can limit the 
values in certain columns based on values in other columns in
 the row.

SQL CHECK Constraint on CREATE TABLE
The following SQL creates a CHECK constraint on the "P_Id"
 column when the "Persons" table is created. The CHECK constraint
 specifies that the column "P_Id" must only include integers 
greater than 0.

MySQL:

->CREATE TABLE Persons
(
P_Id int NOT NULL,
LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
FirstName varchar(255),
Address varchar(255),
City varchar(255),
CHECK (P_Id>0)
)

SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

->CREATE TABLE Persons
(
P_Id int NOT NULL CHECK (P_Id>0),
LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
FirstName varchar(255),
Address varchar(255),
City varchar(255)
)

To allow naming of a CHECK constraint, and for defining a CHECK 
constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:

MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

->CREATE TABLE Persons
(
P_Id int NOT NULL,
LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
FirstName varchar(255),
Address varchar(255),
City varchar(255),
CONSTRAINT chk_Person CHECK (P_Id>0 AND City='Sandnes')
)


SQL CHECK Constraint on ALTER TABLE
To create a CHECK constraint on the "P_Id" column when the table 
is already created, use the following SQL:

MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

->ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD CHECK (P_Id>0)


To allow naming of a CHECK constraint, and for defining a CHECK 
constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:

MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

->ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_Person CHECK (P_Id>0 AND City='Sandnes')



To DROP a CHECK Constraint
To drop a CHECK constraint, use the following SQL:

SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

->ALTER TABLE Persons
DROP CONSTRAINT chk_Person

MySQL:
->ALTER TABLE Persons
DROP CHECK chk_Person
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
SQL DEFAULT Constraint:
The DEFAULT constraint is used to insert a default value into a 
column.

The default value will be added to all new records, if no other 
value is specified.

SQL DEFAULT Constraint on CREATE TABLE:

The following SQL creates a DEFAULT constraint on the "City" 
column when the "Persons" table is created:

My SQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

->CREATE TABLE Persons
(
P_Id int NOT NULL,
LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
FirstName varchar(255),
Address varchar(255),
City varchar(255) DEFAULT 'Sandnes'
)

The DEFAULT constraint can also be used to insert system values,
 by using functions like GETDATE():

->CREATE TABLE Orders
(
O_Id int NOT NULL,
OrderNo int NOT NULL,
P_Id int,
OrderDate date DEFAULT GETDATE()
)

SQL DEFAULT Constraint on ALTER TABLE

To create a DEFAULT constraint on the "City" column when the table
 is already created, use the following SQL:

MySQL:
->ALTER TABLE Persons
ALTER City SET DEFAULT 'SANDNES'

SQL Server / MS Access:
->ALTER TABLE Persons
ALTER COLUMN City SET DEFAULT 'SANDNES'

Oracle:
->ALTER TABLE Persons
MODIFY City DEFAULT 'SANDNES'




To DROP a DEFAULT Constraint:-

To drop a DEFAULT constraint, use the following SQL:

MySQL:
->ALTER TABLE Persons
ALTER City DROP DEFAULT

SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:
->ALTER TABLE Persons
ALTER COLUMN City DROP DEFAULT

The CREATE INDEX statement is used to create indexes in tables.

Indexes allow the database application to find data fast;
 without reading the whole table.

Indexes:
An index can be created in a table to find data more quickly and
 efficiently.

The users cannot see the indexes, they are just used to speed up
 searches/queries.

Note: Updating a table with indexes takes more time than updating
 a table without (because the indexes also need an update). So you
 should only create indexes on columns (and tables) that will be 
frequently searched against.


SQL CREATE INDEX Syntax
Creates an index on a table. Duplicate values are allowed:

->CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column_name)
----------------------------
SQL CREATE UNIQUE INDEX Syntax
Creates a unique index on a table. Duplicate values are not allowed:


->CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column_name)

Note: The syntax for creating indexes varies among different
 databases. Therefore: Check the syntax for creating indexes in
 your database.

CREATE INDEX Example

The SQL statement below creates an index named "PIndex" on the 
"LastName" column in the "Persons" table:

->CREATE INDEX PIndex
ON Persons (LastName)

If you want to create an index on a combination of columns, you
 can list the column names within the parentheses, separated by
 commas:

->CREATE INDEX PIndex
ON Persons (LastName, FirstName)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
SQL DROP INDEX, DROP TABLE, and DROP DATABASE

Indexes, tables, and databases can easily be deleted/removed with 
the DROP statement.

The DROP INDEX Statement
The DROP INDEX statement is used to delete an index in a table.

DROP INDEX Syntax for MS Access:
->DROP INDEX index_name ON table_name

DROP INDEX Syntax for MS SQL Server:
->DROP INDEX table_name.index_name

DROP INDEX Syntax for DB2/Oracle:
->DROP INDEX index_name

DROP INDEX Syntax for MySQL:
->ALTER TABLE table_name DROP INDEX index_name
-------------------------------
The DROP TABLE Statement

The DROP TABLE statement is used to delete a table.
->DROP TABLE table_name


The DROP DATABASE Statement

The DROP DATABASE statement is used to delete a database.

->DROP DATABASE database_name
--------------------------------------------
The TRUNCATE TABLE Statement
What if we only want to delete the data inside the table, and not 
the table itself?

Then, use the TRUNCATE TABLE statement:

->TRUNCATE TABLE table_name
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ALTER TABLE Statement
The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify 
columns in an existing table.

SQL ALTER TABLE Syntax
To add a column in a table, use the following syntax:

->ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name datatype

To delete a column in a table, use the following syntax (notice
 that some database systems don't allow deleting a column):

->ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name


To change the data type of a column in a table, use the following syntax:

SQL Server / MS Access:

->ALTER TABLE table_name
ALTER COLUMN column_name datatype

My SQL / Oracle (prior version 10G):

->ALTER TABLE table_name
MODIFY COLUMN column_name datatype

Oracle 10G and later:

->ALTER TABLE table_name
MODIFY column_name datatype



SQL ALTER TABLE Example

Look at the "Persons" table:

Now we want to add a column named "DateOfBirth" in the "Persons" 
table.

We use the following SQL statement:

->ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD DateOfBirth date

Notice that the new column, "DateOfBirth", is of type date and is 
going to hold a date. The data type specifies what type of data 
the column can hold.


Change Data Type Example
Now we want to change the data type of the column named
 "DateOfBirth" in the "Persons" table.

We use the following SQL statement:

->ALTER TABLE Persons
ALTER COLUMN DateOfBirth year

Notice that the "DateOfBirth" column is now of type year and is 
going to hold a year in a two-digit or four-digit format.


DROP COLUMN Example
Next, we want to delete the column named "DateOfBirth" in the "Persons" table.

We use the following SQL statement:

->ALTER TABLE Persons
DROP COLUMN DateOfBirth
-------------------------------------------------------------------
