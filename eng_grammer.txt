            2. basics of subject and verb

subject:-
two type:- 1.singular 2.plural
singular:-you,he,she,it ,any one name ,any singular noun(in general noun without s/es)

plural:-we,you,they,more than one name,any plural noun(in general noun with s/es).
note:"you" is considered  for both singular and plural.but it takes only "plural" verb.

verb:-four type(for sake of conveince only)
1.singular:-is,has,was,verb(1st form)+s/es
3rd person singular subject only i.e he, she,it,name

2.plural:are,have,were,verb1
all plural subjects(you)

3.common:had,did,modals
all the subjects

4.special:am
i
---------------------------------------------------------
1st person,2nd person ,third person

for instance ,i m talking to somebody
then,"speaker " is the first person
->so 1st person is "either 'i' and 'we' "

and one who is front of me,and listening to what i m saying i.e,listener is the "second person".
->so 2nd person is "you".

the one who is being talked about who is neither the speaker nor the listener is the third person.
->hence the third person would be "he","she","it" or any "name".

------------------------------------------------------------------
--use singular verb with singular 3rd person subject only i.e, he,she,it,name. 
now, we can say

1. she is.
2.she has.
3.she was.
4. she plays.
all four sentence above are correct.

--use of plural verb with plural subject 
now ,can i say
1. they are
2.they have.
3.they were.
4.they play.
all sentence above are correct.

--common verb(had,did,modals) uses for all the subjects
so,can i say(he -singluar subject)
1.he had.
2. he did.
3.he can
all above sentence are correct.

so,can i say,(they -plural subject)
1.they had.
2.they did.
they can.

all above sentences are correct.

-------------------
--special verb
"am" only can be used for 'i'.
'i' is definitely a peculier subject
'i' cannot take verb in deifinite pattern.

'i' sometime takes singular verb,plural verb and special verb

i-is/am/are-use only 'am'
i-was/were-use only 'was'
i-has/have-use only 'have'
i-play/plays-use only 'play'

NOTE:-
noun+s/es=plural
verb+s/es=singular

example:
boys:-we know "boys" is plural because boy is noun.
plays:-we know "plays" is singular verb because play is a verb.

it is important that you will be able to find out subject in a sentence because verb is always in accordance of subject.

Note:for finding out subject,u need to remember 3 points:
1.who does the action?
2.who or what is being talked about?
3.only a noun or pronoun// can be a subject

a.Meg is/are playing basketball.
//"playing" is action,who does this action,Meg(name,third person singular subject,so we use verb "is").
ans)Meg is playing basketball.

b.They is/are going to school.
//"going" is action,who are going,"they"(they is subject,it's plural subject,so we use plural verb.'are' is plural verb.)
ans)they are going to school.

c.He has/have done his work.
//"done" is action,who has done,"he"('he' is subject,'he' is third person singular subject,so it will use with singular verb,"has" is singular verb.)
ans)he has done his work.

d.The price of vegetables has/have increased.
//now,question is what is being talked about."price" for what "vegetables". so price has 
increased. so "main sub" is price. now( 'price' is singular .so we need singular verb."has" is singular verb).
ans)the price of vegetables has increased.


e.Some genuine issues exist/exists with the newly adopted system and need/needs to be examined seriously.
//again, no action being done here.
so we need to find out,what is being talked about.
what is exist with the newly adopted system and what is need to be examined.
ans- issues//(therefore,"issue" is subject.because issue is plural,we need plural verb.so "issue" and "need" is plural verb.)

ans).some genuine issue exist with the newly adopted system and need to be examined seriously.


f.His konwledge of the subject is/are worth appreciating.
//what is worth appreciating,"knowledge".
'konwledge' is subject,since knowledge is singular,we choose singular verb,"is".

ans).His knowledge of the subject is worth appreciating.

g.the quality of goods was/were not good.
// what was not good. "quality" and "goods".
but 'quality' is not good."quality" is singular subject,so, we need singular verb('was').
ans)the quality of goods was not good.
